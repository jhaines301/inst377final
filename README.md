# Project Title: COVID-19 in India

## Description of your project

Our proposed system aims to dynamically display data as it is updated via the API in a
way that is viewable to both the client and general public. This will present daily updates on
Covid-19 cases in India on a state-by-state basis. We have chosen to work with the Covid-19 India API as it provides daily data on testing
numbers, confirmed cases, and recoveries for each state in the country. This can help provide real
time, daily outlook into the state of Covid-19 in the country.

## Description of target browsers (iOS? Android? Which ones?)

For this project, our target devices would be Desktops and mobile. It is done in a way that it will be usable on different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox,...ect
